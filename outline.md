# Being Rust

A guide for new Rust programmers to become great Rust programmers.

Audience: new programmers who have at least read The Rust Book.


## Abstract

This will be a personal talk about the nature of Rust: it's principles,
history, culture, successes and failures; and what it takes to be
a successful Rust programmer, in my personal experience.

I will discuss and demonstrate aspects of my personal Rust workflow, with an
emphasis on conveying how to discover and learn Rust on your own. I will offer
specific tips and observations based on my experience that are not published
elsewhere.

There will be many opportunities to ask Rust-related questions, and recieve
answers from an authority on the subject.


## Author bio

Brian Anderson is a programmer with 9 years of Rust experience. Ex-Mozilla,
ex-Rust core team, currently at PingCAP on TiKV.
