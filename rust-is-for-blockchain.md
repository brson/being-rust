# Rust is for blockchain

Rust is a fairly popular language to build blockchain projects, for obvious
reasons &mdash; blockchain projects need to be reliable, fast, and free of bugs.
They are responsible for securing large volumes of capital, and Rust gives
blockchain developers confidence they can do so. Aimee from Cryptape explains
their rationale in [Why Rust?][wr].

In retrospect blockchains are an obvious market for Rust, but I've
been pleased to see these projects spring up and thrive.

The Rust developer market is very competitive right now. I've talked to may
companies using Rust, and they are nearly all desperate to find talented Rust
developers. This problem seems to be even greater in the Rust-blockchain
industry. Maybe it's because of the stigma &mdash; blockchain has passionate
believers and passionate detractors. I've had the fortune of meeting a number of
people from these projects, and like most people most everywhere, they are good
people with good intentions.

If you are both a Rust developer and a blockchain enthusiast, you have
opportunities available.

Some of these companies, like Parity, have been part of the Rust community a
long time and have contributed significant code back to the community, in the
form of crates, and upstream contributions. They are major users of various
crypto crates, and their experience gives us confidence in them. Some of them
have contributed more than code and have a presence

Some of these are _massive_ Rust projects, some of the largest for sure.

## A domain for Rust

## The virtual machines of blockchain Rust

One of my favorite thing about these projects is that many of them run contracts
on some form of VM, and VM's are fun. Parity has an implementation of EVM (the
Ethereum VM), and WASM. Cryptape's VM runs RISC-V. Solana runs an eBPF VM.

## Companies using Rust for blockchain

Most of these are companies with blockchain projects, some are in the industry
and using Rust for other purposes, some have open source Rust projects, some
_appear_ to have or are very interested in closed source Rust projects.
